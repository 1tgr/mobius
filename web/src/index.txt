<p>Read the <a href="documentation/">Todo List</a> if you're interested in 
developing for The M&ouml;bius but don't know what to work on.</b>
<p>The M&ouml;bius is an open-source operating system for the IA-32 platform (Intel
i386 and compatibles).</p>
<p>There are a lot of other operating systems for the i386:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Windows NT and its successors are closed-source. Their development is
    dictated solely by Microsoft and their interests.</li>
  <li>Windows 95 and its successors are hacks to Windows 3.x and MS-DOS.</li>
  <li>Linux has been going a long time, and has traditionally been a Unix clone.
    As such it is a bit of a hack and is struggling to keep up with modern OS
    concepts.</li>
  <li>Most of the other amateur OS projects consist of a boot sector and a
    'kernel' which prints &quot;Hello, world!&quot;.</li>
  <li>Of the others, most have followed the same path as Linux, without any
    regard to design or future compatibility.</li>
  <li>The small remainder are promising, well-designed operating systems.</li>
</ul>
<p>The M&ouml;bius has been designed as a good modern OS. Its main goals are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>To be extensible enough so that it is easy to modify it for new devices
    and technologies</li>
  <li>To keep the kernel as small and modular as possible</li>
  <li>To support existing applications where possible</li>
  <li>To remain easy enough to use that users can install and configure a M&ouml;bius
    system without having to learn it</li>
</ul>
<p>You can try the OS by downloading a floppy disk image, writing it to a disk
and booting from it. Alternatively, you can use the disk image in an emulator
such as Bochs. Full source code is available through CVS.</p>
