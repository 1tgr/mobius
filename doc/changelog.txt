Changelog for the Möbius Operating System
=========================================

SDK release 4, ??
=================
-- Added HELP, GO and KILL commands to kernel debugger
-- Renamed semaphore_t, SemInit, SemAcquire and SemRelease to spinlock_t,
	SpinInit, SpinAcquire and SpinRelease
-- Implemented graphical startup screen with RLE-compressed bitmap banner
-- Got RTL8139 to respond to pings in under 10ms by removing some trace output
-- Added RTL8139 and NE2000 drivers to CVS

To do before the next kernel release
====================================
-- Fix process exiting bug
-- Fix bad device queued I/O pointer bug (sometimes rtl8139 gets an invalid I/O
	queued just after startup)
-- Put more locks around important data structures

-- Implement shared memory regions as handle objects
-- Allow handle objects to be shared throughout the system, and be given names
-- Put long file name support into FAT FSD
-- Have interrupts enabled in more kernel code (they should only be disabled 
	in interrupt handlers, ideally)

-- Design and implement network stack
-- Merge the vnode concept with the file_t structure
x- Put in some graphical gimmicks so the OS looks nice

SDK release 3, 16th August 2002

	should perform final cleanup for an exiting process)
-- Commented FAT driver nicely
