Changelog for the Möbius Operating System
=========================================

SDK release 4, ??
=================
-- Got a working console server
-- Reimplemented ports, based on pipe
-- Fixed a bug in the DevCfgXXX functions; they were looking in the wrong
	place for the resource array
-- *Maybe* fixed a bug in APC delivery which was stopping pipes and ports 
	working (i386Isr wasn't switching to the address space of the new
	thread, which meant that the APC was running in the wrong process)
-- Started a pipes implementation
-- Tidied up the text output on the boot screen
-- Added HELP, GO and KILL commands to kernel debugger
-- Renamed semaphore_t, SemInit, SemAcquire and SemRelease to spinlock_t,
	SpinInit, SpinAcquire and SpinRelease
-- Implemented graphical startup screen with RLE-compressed bitmap banner
-- Got RTL8139 to respond to pings in under 10ms by removing some trace output
-- Added RTL8139 and NE2000 drivers to CVS
-- Added document describing the kernel debugger
-- Implemented DevCancelIo, which allows the kernel to cancel pending I/O 
	requests (e.g. when a thread exits)
-- Brought sermouse driver up to date

To do before the next kernel release
====================================
-- Fix process exiting bug
-- Fix bad device queued I/O pointer bug (sometimes rtl8139 gets an invalid I/O
	queued just after startup)
-- Put more locks around important data structures
-- Get VMM to store vm_area_t structures better (e.g. binary tree)
-- Generalise text output in the kernel to allow TTY driver to output to a 
	graphical console
x- Provide a way of cancelling I/O requests before they complete

-- Implement shared memory regions as handle objects
-- Allow handle objects to be shared throughout the system, and be given names
-- Put long file name support into FAT FSD
-- Have interrupts enabled in more kernel code (they should only be disabled 
	in interrupt handlers, ideally)
-- Classify driver request codes as user and/or kernel. Only allow user ones 
	through FsPassthrough. Retire FsIoCtl.

-- Design and implement network stack
-- Merge the vnode concept with the file_t structure
x- Put in some graphical gimmicks so the OS looks nice
-- Enforce some driver load order in system.pro. Currently PCI requires ATA 
	loaded first unless all PCI drivers load from ramdisk. This mean that,
	if PCI loads ATA, ATA must arrive first in bus enumeration, which 
	won't happen.

SDK release 3, 16th August 2002
===============================
-- Disabled exit process bug (ProcCleanupProcess doesn't do anything; it
	should perform final cleanup for an exiting process)
-- Commented FAT driver nicely
-- Converted the FAT driver to the newer VFS parsing system
-- Changelog started

About the SDK
=============
The Möbius SDK includes everything you should need to write drivers and 
applications for Möbius. The included binaries allow you to keep a Möbius
installation up-to-date between major releases.

The SDK includes:
-- all header files
-- all libraries
-- all EXEs, DLLs, KLLs and drivers
-- assembly language listing files for the kernel and any drivers whose 
	symbols have been stripped
-- this changelog

It is available for download at http://mobius.sourceforge.net/sdk/
