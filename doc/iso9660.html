<H2>ISO9660 Simplified for DOS/Windows<BR>
by Philip J. Erdelsky</H2>

<H4>1. Introduction</H4>

<P>We weren't sure about it a few years ago, but by now it should be
clear to everyone that CD-ROM's are here to stay. Most PC's are equipped
with CD-ROM readers, and most major PC software packages are being
distributed on CD-ROM's.

<P>Under DOS (and Windows, which uses the DOS file system) files are
written to both hard and floppy disks with a so-called FAT (File
Allocation Table) file system.

<P>Files on a CD-ROM, however, are written to a different standard,
called ISO9660. ISO9660 is rather complex and poorly written, and
obviously contains a number of diplomatic compromises among advocates of
DOS, UNIX, MVS and perhaps other operating systems.

<P>The simplified version presented here includes only features that
would normally be found on a CD-ROM to be used in a DOS system and which
are supported by the Microsoft MS-DOS CD-ROM Extensions (MSCDEX). It is
based on ISO9660, on certain documents regarding MSCDEX (version 2.10),
and on the contents of some actual CD-ROM's.

<P>Where a field has a specific value on a CD-ROM to be used with DOS,
that value is given in this document. However, in some cases a brief
description of values for use with other operating systems is given in
square brackets.

<P>ISO9660 makes provisions for sets of CD-ROM's, and apparently even
permits a file system to span more than one CD-ROM. However, this
feature is not supported by MSCDEX.


<H4>2. Files</H4>

<P>The directory structure on a CD-ROM is almost exactly like that on a
DOS floppy or hard disk. (It is presumed that the reader of this
document is reasonably familiar with the DOS file system.) For this
reason, DOS and Windows applications can read files from a CD-ROM just
as they would from a floppy or hard disk.

<P>There are only a few differences, which do not affect most
applications:

<OL>
<LI>The root directory contains the notorious "." and ".." entries,
just like any other directory.

<LI>There is no limit, other than disk capacity, to the size of the
root directory.

<LI>The depth of directory nesting is limited to eight levels,
including the root. For example, if drive E: contains a CD-ROM,
a file such as E:\D2\D3\D4\D5\D6\D7\D8\FOO.TXT is permitted but
E:\D2\D3\D4\D5\D6\D7\D8\D9\FOO.TXT is not.

<LI>If a CD-ROM is to be used by a DOS system, file names and
extensions must be limited to eight and three characters,
respectively, even though ISO9660 permits longer names and
extensions.

<LI>ISO9660 permits only capital letters, digits and underscores in
a file or directory name or extension, but DOS also permits a
number of other punctuation marks.

<LI>ISO9660 permits a file to have an extension but not a name, but
DOS does not.

<LI>DOS permits a directory to have an extension, but ISO9660 does
not.

<LI>Directories on a CD-ROM are always sorted, as described below.
</OL>

<P>Of course, neither DOS, nor UNIX, nor any other operating system can
WRITE files to a CD-ROM as it would to a floppy or hard disk, because a
CD-ROM is not rewritable. Files must be written to the CD-ROM by a
special program with special hardware.


<H4>3. Sectors</H4>

<P>The information on a CD-ROM is divided into sectors, which are
numbered consecutively, starting with zero. There are no gaps in the
numbering.

<P>Each sector contains 2048 8-bit bytes. (ISO9660 apparently permits
other sector sizes, but the 2048-byte size seems to be universal.)

<P>When a number of sectors are to be read from the CD-ROM, they should
be read in order of increasing sector number, if possible, since that is
the order in which they pass under the read head as the CD-ROM rotates.
Most implementations arrange the information so sectors will be read in
this order for typical file operations, although ISO9660 does not
require this in all cases.

<P>The order of bytes within a sector is considered to be the order in
which they appear when read into memory; i.e., the "first" bytes are
read into the lowest memory addresses. This is also the order used in
this document; i.e., the "first" bytes in any list appear at the top of
the list.


<H4>4. Character Sets</H4>

<P>Names and extensions of files and directories, the volume name, and
some other names are expressed in standard ASCII character codes
(although ISO9660 does not use the name ASCII). According to ISO9660,
only capital letters, digits, and underscores are permitted. However,
DOS permits some other punctuation marks, which are sometimes found on
CD-ROM's, in apparent defiance of ISO9660.

<P>MSCDEX does offer support for the kanji (Japanese) character set.
However, this document does not cover kanji.


<H4>5. Sorting Names or Extensions</H4>

<P>Where ISO9660 requires file or directory names or extensions to be
sorted, the usual ASCII collating sequence is used. That is, two
different names or extensions are compared as follows:

<OL>
<LI>ASCII blanks (32) are added to the right end of the shorter
name or extension, if necessary, to make it as long as the
longer name or extension.

<LI>The first (leftmost) position in which the names or extensions
are not identical determines the order. The name or extension
with the lower ASCII code in that position appears first in the
sorted order.
</OL>


<H4>6. Multiple-Byte Values</H4>

<P>A 16-bit numeric value (usually called a word) may be represented on
a CD-ROM in any of three ways:

<DL>
<DT>Little Endian Word: <DD>The value occupies two consecutive bytes, with
  the less significant byte first.

<DT>Big Endian Word: <DD>The value occupies two consecutive bytes, with
  the more significant byte first.

<DT>Both Endian Word: <DD>The value occupies FOUR consecutive bytes; the
  first and second bytes contain the value expressed as a little
  endian word, and the third and fourth bytes contain the same
  value expressed as a big endian word.
</DL>

<P>A 32-bit numeric value (usually called a double word) may be
represented on a CD-ROM in any of three ways:

<DL>
<DT>Little Endian Double Word: <DD>The value occupies four consecutive
  bytes, with the least significant byte first and the other bytes
  in order of increasing significance.

<DT>Big Endian Double Word: <DD>The value occupies four consecutive bytes,
  with the most significant first and the other bytes in order of
  decreasing significance.

<DT>Both Endian Double Word: <DD>The value occupies EIGHT consecutive
  bytes; the first four bytes contain the value expressed as a
  little endian double word, and the last four bytes contain the
  same value expressed as a big endian double word.
</DL>

<H4>7. The First Sixteen Sectors are Empty</H4>

<P>The first sixteen sectors (sector numbers 0 to 15, inclusive) contain
nothing but zeros. ISO9660 does not define the contents of these
sectors, but for DOS they are apparently always written as zeros. They
are apparently reserved for use by systems that can be booted from a
CD-ROM.


<H4>8. The Volume Descriptors</H4>

<P>Sector 16 and a few of the following sectors contain a series of
volume descriptors. There are several kinds of volume descriptor, but
only two are normally used with DOS. Each volume descriptor occupies
exactly one sector.

<P>The last volume descriptors in the series are one or more Volume
Descriptor Set Terminators. The first seven bytes of a Volume Descriptor
Set Terminator are 255, 67, 68, 48, 48, 49 and 1, respectively. The
other 2041 bytes are zeros. (The middle bytes are the ASCII codes for
the characters CD001.)

<P>The only volume descriptor of real interest under DOS is the Primary
Volume Descriptor. There must be at least one, and there is usually only
one. However, some CD-ROM's have two or more identical Primary Volume
Descriptors. The contents of a Primary Volume Descriptor are as follows:

<pre>
     length
     in bytes  contents
     --------  ---------------------------------------------------------
        1      1
        6      67, 68, 48, 48, 49 and 1, respectively (same as Volume
                 Descriptor Set Terminator)
        1      0
       32      system identifier
       32      volume identifier
        8      zeros
        8      total number of sectors, as a both endian double word
       32      zeros
        4      1, as a both endian word [volume set size]
        4      1, as a both endian word [volume sequence number]
        4      2048 (the sector size), as a both endian word
        8      path table length in bytes, as a both endian double word
        4      number of first sector in first little endian path table,
                 as a little endian double word
        4      number of first sector in second little endian path table,
                 as a little endian double word, or zero if there is no
                 second little endian path table
        4      number of first sector in first big endian path table,
                 as a big endian double word
        4      number of first sector in second big endian path table,
                 as a big endian double word, or zero if there is no
                 second big endian path table
       34      root directory record, as described below
      128      volume set identifier
      128      publisher identifier
      128      data preparer identifier
      128      application identifier
       37      copyright file identifier
       37      abstract file identifier
       37      bibliographical file identifier
       17      date and time of volume creation
       17      date and time of most recent modification
       17      date and time when volume expires
       17      date and time when volume is effective
        1      1
        1      0
      512      reserved for application use (usually zeros)
      653      zeros
</pre>

<P>The first 11 characters of the volume identifier are returned as the
volume identifier by standard DOS system calls and utilities.

<P>Other identifiers are not used by DOS, and may be filled with ASCII
blanks (32).

<P>Each date and time field is of the following form:

<pre>
     length
     in bytes  contents
     --------  ---------------------------------------------------------
        4      year, as four ASCII digits
        2      month, as two ASCII digits, where
                 01=January, 02=February, etc.
        2      day of month, as two ASCII digits, in the range
                 from 01 to 31
        2      hour, as two ASCII digits, in the range from 00 to 23
        2      minute, as two ASCII digits, in the range from 00 to 59
        2      second, as two ASCII digits, in the range from 00 to 59
        2      hundredths of a second, as two ASCII digits, in the range
                 from 00 to 99
        1      offset from Greenwich Mean Time, in 15-minute intervals,
                 as a twos complement signed number, positive for time
                 zones east of Greenwich, and negative for time zones
                 west of Greenwich
</pre>

<P>If the date and time are not specified, the first 16 bytes are all
ASCII zeros (48), and the last byte is zero.

<P>Other kinds of Volume Descriptors (which are normally ignored by DOS)
have the following format:

<pre>
     length
     in bytes  contents
     --------  ---------------------------------------------------------
        1      neither 1 nor 255
        6      67, 68, 48, 48, 49 and 1, respectively (same as Volume
                 Descriptor Set Terminator)
      2041     other things
</pre>

<H4>9. Path Tables</H4>

<P>The path tables normally come right after the volume descriptors.
However, ISO9660 merely requires that each path table begin in the
sector specified by the Primary Volume Descriptor.

<P>The path tables are actually redundant, since all of the information
contained in them is also stored elsewhere on the CD-ROM. However, their
use can make directory searches much faster.

<P>There are two kinds of path table -- a little endian path table, in
which multiple-byte values are stored in little endian order, and a big
endian path table, in which multiple-byte values are stored in big
endian order. The two kinds of path tables are identical in every other
way.

<P>A path table contains one record for each directory on the CD-ROM
(including the root directory). The format of a record is as follows:

<pre>
     length
     in bytes  contents
     --------  ---------------------------------------------------------
        1      N, the name length (or 1 for the root directory)
        1      0 [number of sectors in extended attribute record]
        4      number of the first sector in the directory, as a
                 double word
        2      number of record for parent directory (or 1 for the root
                 directory), as a word; the first record is number 1,
                 the second record is number 2, etc.
        N      name (or 0 for the root directory)
      0 or 1   padding byte: if N is odd, this field contains a zero; if
                 N is even, this field is omitted
</pre>

<P>According to ISO9660, a directory name consists of at least one and
not more than 31 capital letters, digits and underscores. For DOS the
upper limit is eight characters.

<P>A path table occupies as many consecutive sectors as may be required
to hold all its records. The first record always begins in the first
byte of the first sector. Except for the single byte described above, no
padding is used between records; hence the last record in a sector is
usually continued in the next following sector. The unused part of the
last sector is filled with zeros.

<P>The records in a path table are arranged in a precisely specified
order. For this purpose, each directory has an associated number called
its level. The level of the root directory is 1. The level of each other
directory is one greater than the level of its parent. As noted above,
ISO9660 does not permit levels greater than 8.

<P>The relative positions of any two records are determined as follows:

<OL>
<LI>If the levels are different, the directory with the lower level
appears first. In particular, this implies that the root
directory is always represented by the first record in the
table, because it is the only directory with level 1.

<LI>If the levels are identical, but the directories have different
parents, then the directories are in the same relative
positions as their parents.

<LI>Directories with the same level and the same parent are
arranged in the order obtained by sorting on their names, as
described in Section 5.
</OL>


<H4>10. Directories</H4>

<P>A directory consists of a series of directory records in one or more
consecutive sectors. However, unlike path records, directory records may
not straddle sector boundaries. There may be unused space at the end of
each sector, which is filled with zeros.

<P>Each directory record represents a file or directory. Its format is
as follows:

<pre>
     length
     in bytes  contents
     --------  ---------------------------------------------------------
        1      R, the number of bytes in the record (which must be even)
        1      0 [number of sectors in extended attribute record]
        8      number of the first sector of file data or directory
                 (zero for an empty file), as a both endian double word
        8      number of bytes of file data or length of directory,
                 excluding the extended attribute record,
                 as a both endian double word
        1      number of years since 1900
        1      month, where 1=January, 2=February, etc.
        1      day of month, in the range from 1 to 31
        1      hour, in the range from 0 to 23
        1      minute, in the range from 0 to 59
        1      second, in the range from 0 to 59
                 (for DOS this is always an even number)
        1      offset from Greenwich Mean Time, in 15-minute intervals,
                 as a twos complement signed number, positive for time
                 zones east of Greenwich, and negative for time zones
                 west of Greenwich (DOS ignores this field)
        1      flags, with bits as follows:
                 bit     value
                 ------  ------------------------------------------
                 0 (LS)  0 for a norma1 file, 1 for a hidden file
                 1       0 for a file, 1 for a directory
                 2       0 [1 for an associated file]
                 3       0 [1 for record format specified]
                 4       0 [1 for permissions specified]
                 5       0
                 6       0
                 7 (MS)  0 [1 if not the final record for the file]
        1      0 [file unit size for an interleaved file]
        1      0 [interleave gap size for an interleaved file]
        4      1, as a both endian word [volume sequence number]
        1      N, the identifier length
        N      identifier
        P      padding byte: if N is even, P = 1 and this field contains
                 a zero; if N is odd, P = 0 and this field is omitted
    R-33-N-P   unspecified field for system use; must contain an even
                 number of bytes
</pre>

<P>The length of a directory includes the unused space, if any, at the
ends of sectors. Hence it is always an exact multiple of 2048 (the
sector size). Since every directory, even a nominally empty one,
contains at least two records, the length of a directory is never zero.

<P>All fields in the first record (sometimes called the "." record)
refer to the directory itself, except that the identifier length is 1,
and the identifier is zero. The root directory record in the Primary
Volume Descriptor also has this format.

<P>All fields in the second record (sometimes called the ".." record)
refer to the parent directory, except that the identifier length is 1,
and the identifier is 1. The second record in the root directory refers
to the root directory.

<P>The identifier for a subdirectory is its name. The identifier for a
file consists of the following fields, in the order given:

<OL>
<LI>The name, consisting of the ASCII codes for at least one and
not more than eight capital letters, digits and underscores.

<LI>If there is an extension, the ASCII code for a period (46). If
there is no extension, this field is omitted.

<LI>The extension, consisting of the ASCII codes for not more than
three capital letters, digits and underscores. If there is no
extension, this field is omitted.

<LI>The ASCII code for a semicolon (59).

<LI>The ASCII code for 1 (49). [On other systems, this is the
version number, consisting of the ASCII codes for a sequence of
digits representing a number between 1 and 32767, inclusive.]
</OL>

<P>Some implementations for DOS omit (4) and (5), and some use
punctuation marks other than underscores in file names and extensions.

<P>Directory records other than the first two are sorted as follows:

<OL>
<LI>Records are sorted by name, as described above.

<LI>Every series of records with the same name is sorted by
extension, as described above. For this purpose, a record
without an extension is sorted as though its extension
consisted of ASCII blanks (32).

<LI>[On other systems, every series of records with the same name
and extension is sorted in order of decreasing version number.]

<LI>[On other systems, two records with the same name, extension
and version number are permitted, if the first record is an
associated file.]
</OL>

<P>[ISO9660 permits names containing more than eight characters and
extensions containing more than three characters, as long as both of
them together contain no more than 30 characters.]

<P>It is apparently permissible under ISO9660 to use two or more
consecutive records to represent consecutive pieces of the same file.
Bit 7 of the flags byte is set in every record except the last one.
However, this technique seems pointless and is apparently not used. It
is not supported by MSCDEX.

<P>Interleaving is another technique that is apparently seldom used. It
is not supported by MSCDEX (version 2.10).


<H4>11. Arrangement of Directory and Data Sectors</H4>

<P>ISO9660 does not specify the order of directory or file sectors. It
merely requires that the first sector of each directory or file be in
the location specified by its directory record, and that the sectors for
directories and non-interleaved files be consecutive.

<P>However, most implementations arrange the directories so each
directory follows its parent, and the data sectors for the files in each
directory lie immediately after the directory and immediately before the
next following directory. This appears to be an efficient arrangement
for most applications.

<P>Some implementations go one step further and order the directories in
the same manner as the corresponding path table records.


<H4>12. Extended Attribute Records</H4>

<P>Extended attribute records contain file and directory information
used by operating systems other than DOS, such as permissions and
logical record lengths.

<P>A CD-ROM written for DOS normally does not contain any extended
attribute records.

<P>When reading a CD-ROM containing extended attribute records, early
versions of MSCDEX simply returned incorrect results. Later versions
learned to skip over extended attribute records.
