Handy features to include
=========================

Port file system
----------------
* Create a file in /System/ports/
* Give it a name (e.g. WindowServer or TCP:80)
* Tell it to either connect or listen
* Read/write/etc.

Entity names
------------
* Global names given to parts of the file system
* e.g. Packages => /Local/My Hard Drive/Software/Packages
* Packages:gcc/bin/gcc.exe => /Local/My Hard Drive/Software/Packages/gcc/bin/gcc.exe

Waiting in the kernel (or I/O completion procedures)
---------------------
* Layered I/O model needs this!
* It's no use having an async I/O model if the FSD blocks while talking to the hardware
