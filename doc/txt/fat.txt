FAT: General Overview of On-Disk Format


Version 1.02, May 5, 1999
Microsoft Corporation


The FAT (File Allocation Table) file system has its origins
in the late 1970s and early1980s and was the file system
supported by the Microsoft© MS-DOS© operating system. It was
originally developed as a simple file system suitable for
floppy disk drives less than 500K in size. Over time it has
been enhanced to support larger and larger media. Currently
there are three FAT file system types: FAT12, FAT16 and
FAT32. The basic difference in these FAT sub types, and the
reason for the names, is the size, in bits, of the entries
in the actual FAT structure on the disk. There are 12 bits
in a FAT12 FAT entry, 16 bits in a FAT16 FAT entry and 32
bits in a FAT32 FAT entry.

treaties, as well as other intellectual property laws and
treaties.
1.    LIMITED COVENANT NOT TO SUE.
 (a)  Provided that you comply with all terms and
 conditions of this Agreement and subject to the
 limitations in Sections 1(b) - (e) below, Microsoft grants
 to you the following non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-
 free, non-transferable, non-sublicenseable, reciprocal
 limited covenant not to sue:
     (i)  under any copyrights owned or licensable by Microsoft
          without payment of consideration to unaffiliated third
          parties, to reproduce the Specification solely for the
          purposes of creating portions of products which comply with
          the Specification in unmodified form; and
     (ii) under its Necessary Claims solely to make, have
          made, use, import, and directly and indirectly,
          offer to sell, sell and otherwise distribute and
          dispose of portions of products which comply with
          the Specification in unmodified form.
     For purposes of the foregoing, the Specification is
     "unmodified" if there are no changes, additions or
     extensions to the Specification, and "Necessary Claims"
     means claims of a patent or patent application which
     are (1) owned or licenseable by Microsoft without
     payment of consideration to an unaffiliated third
     party; and (2) have an effective filing date on or
     before December 31, 2010, that must be infringed in
     order to make a portion(s) of a product that complies
     with the Specification.  Necessary Claims does not
     include claims relating to semiconductor manufacturing
     technology or microprocessor circuits or claims not
     required to be infringed in complying with the
     Specification (even if in the same patent as Necessary
     Claims).
     
 (b)  The foregoing covenant not to sue shall not extend to
 any part or function of a product  which (i) is not
 required to comply with the Specification in unmodified
 form, or (ii) to which there was a commercially reasonable
 alternative to infringing a Necessary Claim.
 
 (c)  The covenant not to sue described above shall be
 unavailable to you and shall terminate immediately if you
 or any of your Affiliates (collectively "Covenantee
 Party") "Initiates" any action for patent infringement
 against:  (x) Microsoft or any of its Affiliates
 (collectively "Granting Party"), (y) any customers or
 distributors of the Granting Party, or other recipients of
 a covenant not to sue with respect to the Specification
 from the Granting Party ("Covenantees"); or (z) any
 customers or distributors of Covenantees (all parties
 identified in (y) and (z) collectively referred to as
 "Customers"), which action is based on a conformant
 implementation of the Specification.  As used herein,
 "Affiliate" means any entity which directly or indirectly
 controls, is controlled by, or is under common control
 with a party; and control shall mean the power, whether
 direct or indirect, to direct or cause the direct of the
 management or policies of any entity whether through the
 ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise.
 "Initiates" means that a Covenantee Party is the first (as
 between the Granting Party and the Covenantee Party) to
 file or institute any legal or administrative claim or
 action for patent infringement against the Granting Party
 or any of the Customers. "Initiates" includes any
 situation in which a Covenantee Party files or initiates a
 legal or administrative claim or action for patent
 infringement solely as a counterclaim or equivalent in
 response to a Granting Party first filing or instituting a
 legal or administrative patent infringement claim against
 such Covenantee Party.
 
 (d)  The covenant not to sue described above shall not
 extend to your use of any portion of the Specification for
 any purpose other than (a) to create portions of an
 operating system (i) only as necessary to adapt such
 operating system so that it can directly interact with a

Notational Conventions in this Document

Numbers that have the characters "0x" at the beginning of
them are hexadecimal (base 16) numbers.

Any numbers that do not have the characters "0x" at the
beginning are decimal (base 10) numbers.

The code fragments in this document are written in the 'C'
programming language. Strict typing and syntax are not
adhered to.

There are several code fragments in this document that
freely mix 32-bit and 16-bit data elements. It is assumed
that you are a programmer who understands how to properly
type such operations so that data is not lost due to
truncation of 32-bit values to 16-bit values. Also take note
that all data types are UNSIGNED. Do not do FAT computations
with signed integer types, because the computations will be
wrong on some FAT volumes.

General Comments (Applicable to FAT File System All Types)
All of the FAT file systems were originally developed for
the IBM PC machine architecture. The importance of this is
that FAT file system on disk data structure is all "little
endian." If we look at one 32-bit FAT entry stored on disk
as a series of four 8-bit bytes-the first being byte[0] and
the last being byte[4]-here is where the 32 bits numbered 00
through 31 are (00 being the least significant bit):

byte[3]        3 3 2 2 2 2 2 2
          1 0 9 8 7 6 5 4

byte[2]        2 2 2 2 1 1 1 1
          3 2 1 0 9 8 7 6

byte[1]        1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0
          5 4 3 2 1 0 9 8

byte[0]        0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
          7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0
               
This is important if your machine is a "big endian" machine,
because you will have to translate between big and little
endian as you move data to and from the disk.

A FAT file system volume is composed of four basic regions,
which are laid out in this order on the volume:
     0 - Reserved Region
     1 - FAT Region
     2 - Root Directory Region (doesn't exist on FAT32
volumes)
     3 - File and Directory Data Region

Boot Sector and BPB
The first important data structure on a FAT volume is called
the BPB (BIOS Parameter Block), which is located in the
first sector of the volume in the Reserved Region. This
sector is sometimes called the "boot sector" or the
"reserved sector" or the "0th sector," but the important
fact is simply that it is the first sector of the volume.

This is the first thing about the FAT file system that
sometimes causes confusion. In MS-DOS version 1.x, there was
not a BPB in the boot sector. In this first version of the
FAT file system, there were only two different formats, the
one for single-sided and the one for double-sided 360K 5.25-
inch floppy disks. The determination of which type was on
the disk was done by looking at the first byte of the FAT
(the low 8 bits of FAT[0]).

This type of media determination was superseded in MS-DOS
version 2.x by putting a BPB in the boot sector, and the old
style of media determination (done by looking at the first
byte of the FAT) was no longer supported. All FAT volumes
must have a BPB in the boot sector.

This brings us to the second point of confusion relating to
FAT volume determination: What exactly does a BPB look like?
The BPB in the boot sector defined for MS-DOS 2.x only
allowed for a FAT volume with strictly less than 65,536
sectors (32 MB worth of 512-byte sectors). This limitation
was due to the fact that the "total sectors" field was only
a 16-bit field. This limitation was addressed by MS-DOS 3.x,
where the BPB was modified to include a new 32-bit field for
the total sectors value.

The next BPB change occurred with the Microsoft Windows 95
operating system, where the FAT32 type was introduced. FAT16
was limited by the maximum size of the FAT and the maximum
valid cluster size to no more than a 2 GB volume if the disk
had 512-byte sectors. FAT32 addressed this limitation on the
amount of disk space that one FAT volume could occupy so
that disks larger than 2 GB only had to have one partition
defined.

The FAT32 BPB exactly matches the FAT12/FAT16 BPB up to and
including the BPB_TotSec32 field. They differ starting at
offset 36, depending on whether the media type is
FAT12/FAT16 or FAT32 (see discussion below for determining
FAT type). The relevant point here is that the BPB in the
boot sector of a FAT volume should always be one that has
all of the new BPB fields for either the FAT12/FAT16 or
FAT32 BPB type. Doing it this way ensures the maximum
compatibility of the FAT volume and ensures that all FAT
file system drivers will understand and support the volume
properly, because it always contains all of the currently
defined fields.

NOTE: In the following description, all the fields whose
names start with BPB_ are part of the BPB. All the fields
whose names start with BS_ are part of the boot sector and
not really part of the BPB. The following shows the start of
sector 0 of a FAT volume, which contains the BPB:


 Boot Sector and BPB Structure
Name       Offs  Size  Description
           et    (byt
           (byt  es)
           e)
BS_jmpBoot 0     3     Jump instruction to boot code.
                       This field has two allowed forms:
                       jmpBoot[0] = 0xEB, jmpBoot[1] =
                       0x??, jmpBoot[2] = 0x90
                       and
                       jmpBoot[0] = 0xE9, jmpBoot[1] =
                       0x??, jmpBoot[2] = 0x??
                       
                       0x?? indicates that any 8-bit
                       value is allowed in that byte.
                       What this forms is a three-byte
                       Intel x86 unconditional branch
                       (jump) instruction that jumps to
                       the start of the operating system
                       bootstrap code. This code
                       typically occupies the rest of
                       sector 0 of the volume following
                       the BPB and possibly other
                       sectors. Either of these forms is
                       acceptable. JmpBoot[0] = 0xEB is
                       the more frequently used format.
BS_OEMName 3     8     "MSWIN4.1" There are many
                       misconceptions about this field.
                       It is only a name string.
                       Microsoft operating systems don't
                       pay any attention to this field.
                       Some FAT drivers do. This is the
                       reason that the indicated string,
                       "MSWIN4.1", is the recommended
                       setting, because it is the setting
                       least likely to cause
                       compatibility problems. If you
                       want to put something else in
                       here, that is your option, but the
                       result may be that some FAT
                       drivers might not recognize the
                       volume. Typically this is some
                       indication of what system
                       formatted the volume.
BPB_BytsPe 11    2     Count of bytes per sector. This
rSec                   value may take on only the
                       following values: 512, 1024, 2048
                       or 4096. If maximum compatibility
                       is desired, only the value 512
                       should be used. There is a lot of
                       FAT code in the world that is
                       basically "hard wired" to 512
                       bytes per sector and doesn't
                       bother to check this field to make
                       sure it is 512. Microsoft
                       operating systems will properly
                       support 1024, 2048, and 4096, but
                       these values are not recommended.
BPB_SecPer 13    1     Number of sectors per allocation
Clus                   unit. This value must be a power
                       of 2 that is greater than 0. The
                       legal values are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16,
                       32, 64, and 128. Note however,
                       that a value should never be used
                       that results in a "bytes per
                       cluster" value (BPB_BytsPerSec *
                       BPB_SecPerClus) greater than 32K
                       (32 * 1024). There is a
                       misconception that values greater
                       than this are OK. Values that
                       cause a cluster size greater than
                       32K bytes do not work properly; do
                       not try to define one. Some
                       versions of some systems allow 64K
                       bytes per cluster value. Many
                       application setup programs will
                       not work correctly on such a FAT
                       volume.
BPB_RsvdSe 14    2     Number of reserved sectors in the
cCnt                   Reserved region of the volume
                       starting at the first sector of
                       the volume. This field must not be
                       0. For FAT12 and FAT16 volumes,
                       this value should never be
                       anything other than 1. For FAT32
                       volumes, this value is typically
                       32. There is a lot of FAT code in
                       the world "hard wired" to 1
                       reserved sector for FAT12 and
                       FAT16 volumes and that doesn't
                       bother to check this field to make
                       sure it is 1. Microsoft operating
                       systems will properly support any
                       non-zero value in this field.
BPB_NumFAT 16    1     The count of FAT data structures
s                      on the volume. This field should
                       always contain the value 2 for any
                       FAT volume of any type. Although
                       any value greater than or equal to
                       1 is perfectly valid, many
                       software programs and a few
                       operating systems' FAT file system
                       drivers may not function properly
                       if the value is something other
                       than 2. All Microsoft file system
                       drivers will support a value other
                       than 2, but it is still highly
                       recommended that no value other
                       than 2 be used in this field.
                       
                       The reason the standard value for
                       this field is 2 is to provide
                       redundancy for the FAT data
                       structure so that if a sector goes
                       bad in one of the FATs, that data
                       is not lost because it is
                       duplicated in the other FAT. On
                       non-disk-based media, such as
                       FLASH memory cards, where such
                       redundancy is a useless feature, a
                       value of 1 may be used to save the
                       space that a second copy of the
                       FAT uses, but some FAT file system
                       drivers might not recognize such a
                       volume properly.
BPB_RootEn 17    2     For FAT12 and FAT16 volumes, this
tCnt                   field contains the count of 32-
                       byte directory entries in the root
                       directory. For FAT32 volumes, this
                       field must be set to 0. For FAT12
                       and FAT16 volumes, this value
                       should always specify a count that
                       when multiplied by 32 results in
                       an even multiple of
                       BPB_BytsPerSec. For maximum
                       compatibility, FAT16 volumes
                       should use the value 512.
BPB_TotSec 19    2     This field is the old 16-bit total
16                     count of sectors on the volume.
                       This count includes the count of
                       all sectors in all four regions of
                       the volume. This field can be 0;
                       if it is 0, then BPB_TotSec32 must
                       be non-zero. For FAT32 volumes,
                       this field must be 0. For FAT12
                       and FAT16 volumes, this field
                       contains the sector count, and
                       BPB_TotSec32 is 0 if the total
                       sector count "fits" (is less than
                       0x10000).
BPB_Media  21    1     0xF8 is the standard value for
                       "fixed" (non-removable) media. For
                       removable media, 0xF0 is
                       frequently used. The legal values
                       for this field are 0xF0, 0xF8,
                       0xF9, 0xFA, 0xFB, 0xFC, 0xFD,
                       0xFE, and 0xFF. The only other
                       important point is that whatever
                       value is put in here must also be
                       put in the low byte of the FAT[0]
                       entry. This dates back to the old
                       MS-DOS 1.x media determination
                       noted earlier and is no longer
                       usually used for anything.
BPB_FATSz1 22    2     This field is the FAT12/FAT16 16-
6                      bit count of sectors occupied by
                       ONE FAT. On FAT32 volumes this
                       field must be 0, and BPB_FATSz32
                       contains the FAT size count.
BPB_SecPer 24    2     Sectors per track for interrupt
Trk                    0x13. This field is only relevant
                       for media that have a geometry
                       (volume is broken down into tracks
                       by multiple heads and cylinders)
                       and are visible on interrupt 0x13.
                       This field contains the "sectors
                       per track" geometry value.
BPB_NumHea 26    2     Number of heads for interrupt
ds                     0x13. This field is relevant as
                       discussed earlier for
                       BPB_SecPerTrk. This field contains
                       the one based "count of heads".
                       For example, on a 1.44 MB 3.5-inch
                       floppy drive this value is 2.
BPB_HiddSe 28    4     Count of hidden sectors preceding
c                      the partition that contains this
                       FAT volume. This field is
                       generally only relevant for media
                       visible on interrupt 0x13. This
                       field should always be zero on
                       media that are not partitioned.
                       Exactly what value is appropriate
                       is operating system specific.
BPB_TotSec 32    4     This field is the new 32-bit total
32                     count of sectors on the volume.
                       This count includes the count of
                       all sectors in all four regions of
                       the volume. This field can be 0;
                       if it is 0, then BPB_TotSec16 must
                       be non-zero. For FAT32 volumes,
                       this field must be non-zero. For
                       FAT12/FAT16 volumes, this field
                       contains the sector count if
                       BPB_TotSec16 is 0 (count is
                       greater than or equal to 0x10000).

At this point, the BPB/boot sector for FAT12 and FAT16
differs from the BPB/boot sector for FAT32. The first table
shows the structure for FAT12 and FAT16 starting at offset
36 of the boot sector.

BS_DrvNum  36    1     Int 0x13 drive number (e.g. 0x80).
                       This field supports MS-DOS
                       bootstrap and is set to the INT
                       0x13 drive number of the media
                       (0x00 for floppy disks, 0x80 for
                       hard disks).

                       should always set this byte to 0.
BS_BootSig 38    1     Extended boot signature (0x29).
                       This is a signature byte that
                       indicates that the following three
                       fields in the boot sector are
                       present.
BS_VolID   39    4     Volume serial number. This field,
                       together with BS_VolLab, supports
                       volume tracking on removable
                       media. These values allow FAT file
                       system drivers to detect that the
                       wrong disk is inserted in a
                       removable drive. This ID is
                       usually generated by simply
                       combining the current date and
                       time into a 32-bit value.
BS_VolLab  43    11    Volume label. This field matches
                       the 11-byte volume label recorded
                       in the root directory.
                       NOTE: FAT file system drivers
                       should make sure that they update
                       this field when the volume label
                       file in the root directory has its
                       name changed or created. The
                       setting for this field when there
                       is no volume label is the string
                       "NO NAME    ".
BS_FilSysT 54    8     One of the strings "FAT12   ",
ype                    "FAT16   ", or "FAT     ".  NOTE:
                       Many people think that the string
                       in this field has something to do
                       with the determination of what
                       type of FAT-FAT12, FAT16, or
                       FAT32-that the volume has. This is
                       not true. You will note from its
                       name that this field is not
                       actually part of the BPB. This
                       string is informational only and
                       is not used by Microsoft file
                       system drivers to determine FAT
                       typ,e because it is frequently not
                       set correctly or is not present.
                       See the FAT Type Determination
                       section of this document. This
                       string should be set based on the
                       FAT type though, because some non-
                       Microsoft FAT file system drivers
                       do look at it.

Here is the structure for FAT32 starting at offset 36 of the

                       the future without worrying about
                       old FAT32 drivers mounting the
                       volume. This document defines the

                       non-zero, back-level Windows
                       versions will not mount the

                       NOTE:  Disk utilities should
                       respect this field and not operate
                       on volumes with a higher major or
                       minor version number than that for
                       which they were designed. FAT32
                       file system drivers must check
                       this field and not mount the
                       volume if it does not contain a

                       the time the driver was written.
BPB_RootCl 44    4     This field is only defined for

                       to the cluster number of the first

                       usually 2 but not required to be
                       2.
                       NOTE:  Disk utilities that change
                       the location of the root directory
                       should make every effort to place
                       the first cluster of the root
                       directory in the first non-bad
                       cluster on the drive (i.e., in
                       cluster 2, unless it's marked
                       bad). This is specified so that
                       disk repair utilities can easily
                       find the root directory if this

BS_FilSysT 82    8     Always set to the string "FAT32
ype                    ".  Please see the note for this
                       field in the FAT12/FAT16 section
                       earlier. This field has nothing to
                       do with FAT type determination.

There is one other important note about Sector 0 of a FAT
volume. If we consider the contents of the sector as a byte
array, it must be true that sector[510] equals 0x55, and
sector[511] equals 0xAA.

NOTE: Many FAT documents mistakenly say that this 0xAA55
signature occupies the "last 2 bytes of the boot sector".
This statement is correct if - and only if - BPB_BytsPerSec
is 512. If BPB_BytsPerSec is greater than 512, the offsets
of these signature bytes do not change (although it is
perfectly OK for the last two bytes at the end of the boot
sector to also contain this signature).

Check your assumptions about the value in the
BPB_TotSec16/32 field. Assume we have a disk or partition of
size in sectors DskSz. If the BPB TotSec field (either
BPB_TotSec16 or BPB_TotSec32 - whichever is non-zero) is
less than or equal to DskSz, there is nothing whatsoever
wrong with the FAT volume. In fact, it is not at all unusual
to have a BPB_TotSec16/32 value that is slightly smaller
than DskSz. It is also perfectly OK for the BPB_TotSec16/32
value to be considerably smaller than DskSz.

All this means is that disk space is being wasted. It does
not by itself mean that the FAT volume is damaged in some
way. However, if BPB_TotSec16/32 is larger than DskSz, the
volume is seriously damaged or malformed because it extends
past the end of the media or overlaps data that follows it
on the disk. Treating a volume for which the BPB_TotSec16/32
value is "too large" for the media or partition as valid can
lead to catastrophic data loss.

FAT Data Structure
The next data structure that is important is the FAT itself.
What this data structure does is define a singly linked list
of the "extents" (clusters) of a file. Note at this point
that a FAT directory or file container is nothing but a
regular file that has a special attribute indicating it is a
directory. The only other special thing about a directory is
that the data or contents of the "file" is a series of
32=byte FAT directory entries (see discussion below). In all
other respects, a directory is just like a file. The FAT
maps the data region of the volume by cluster number. The
first data cluster is cluster 2.

The first sector of cluster 2 (the data region of the disk)
is computed using the BPB fields for the volume as follows.
First, we determine the count of sectors occupied by the
root directory:

RootDirSectors = ((BPB_RootEntCnt * 32) + (BPB_BytsPerSec -
1)) / BPB_BytsPerSec;

Note that on a FAT32 volume the BPB_RootEntCnt value is
always 0, so on a FAT32 volume RootDirSectors is always 0.
The 32 in the above is the size of one FAT directory entry
in bytes. Note also that this computation rounds up.

The start of the data region, the first sector of cluster 2,
is computed as follows:

If(BPB_FATSz16 != 0)
    FATSz = BPB_FATSz16;
Else
    FATSz = BPB_FATSz32;

FirstDataSector = BPB_ResvdSecCnt + (BPB_NumFATs * FATSz) +
RootDirSectors;

NOTE: This sector number is relative to the first sector of
the volume that contains the BPB (the sector that contains
the BPB is sector number 0). This does not necessarily map
directly onto the drive, because sector 0 of the volume is
not necessarily sector 0 of the drive due to partitioning.

Given any valid data cluster number N, the sector number of
the first sector of that cluster (again relative to sector 0
of the FAT volume) is computed as follows:

FirstSectorofCluster = ((N - 2) * BPB_SecPerClus) +
FirstDataSector;

NOTE: Because BPB_SecPerClus is restricted to powers of 2
(1,2,4,8,16,32..), this means that division and
multiplication by BPB_SecPerClus can actually be performed
via SHIFT operations on 2s complement architectures that are
usually faster instructions than MULT and DIV instructions.
On current Intel X86 processors, this is largely irrelevant
though because the MULT and DIV machine instructions are
heavily optimized for multiplication and division by powers
of 2.

FAT Type Determination
There is considerable confusion over exactly how this works,
which leads to many "off by 1", "off by 2", "off by 10", and
"massively off" errors. It is really quite simple how this
works. The FAT type-one of FAT12, FAT16, or FAT32-is
determined by the count of clusters on the volume and
nothing else.

Please read everything in this section carefully, all of the
words are important. For example, note that the statement
was "count of clusters." This is not the same thing as
"maximum valid cluster number," because the first data
cluster is 2 and not 0 or 1.

To begin, let's discuss exactly how the "count of clusters"
value is determined. This is all done using the BPB fields
for the volume. First, we determine the count of sectors
occupied by the root directory as noted earlier.

RootDirSectors = ((BPB_RootEntCnt * 32) + (BPB_BytsPerSec -
1)) / BPB_BytsPerSec;

Note that on a FAT32 volume, the BPB_RootEntCnt value is
always 0; so on a FAT32 volume, RootDirSectors is always 0.

Next, we determine the count of sectors in the data region
of the volume:

If(BPB_FATSz16 != 0)
    FATSz = BPB_FATSz16;
Else
    FATSz = BPB_FATSz32;

If(BPB_TotSec16 != 0)
    TotSec = BPB_TotSec16;
Else
    TotSec = BPB_TotSec32;

DataSec = TotSec - (BPB_ResvdSecCnt + (BPB_NumFATs * FATSz)
+ RootDirSectors);

Now we determine the count of clusters:

CountofClusters = DataSec / BPB_SecPerClus;

Please note that this computation rounds down.

Now we can determine the FAT type. Please note carefully or
you will commit an off-by-one error!

In the following example, when it says <, it does not mean
<=. Note also that the numbers are correct. The first number
for FAT12 is 4085; the second number for FAT16 is 65525.
These numbers and the '<' signs are not wrong.

If(CountofClusters < 4085) {
/* Volume is FAT12 */
} else if(CountofClusters < 65525) {
    /* Volume is FAT16 */
} else {
    /* Volume is FAT32 */
}

This is the one and only way that FAT type is determined.
There is no such thing as a FAT12 volume that has more than
4084 clusters. There is no such thing as a FAT16 volume that
has less than 4085 clusters or more than 65,524 clusters.
There is no such thing as a FAT32 volume that has less than
65,525 clusters. If you try to make a FAT volume that
violates this rule, Microsoft operating systems will not
handle them correctly because they will think the volume has
a different type of FAT than what you think it does.

NOTE: As is noted numerous times earlier, the world is full
of FAT code that is wrong. There is a lot of FAT type code
that is off by 1 or 2 or 8 or 10 or 16. For this reason, it
is highly recommended that if you are formatting a FAT
volume which has maximum compatibility with all existing FAT
code, then you should you avoid making volumes of any type
that have close to 4,085 or 65,525 clusters. Stay at least
16 clusters on each side away from these cut-over cluster
counts.

Note also that the CountofClusters value is exactly that-the
count of data clusters starting at cluster 2. The maximum
valid cluster number for the volume is CountofClusters + 1,
and the "count of clusters including the two reserved
clusters" is CountofClusters + 2.

There is one more important computation related to the FAT.
Given any valid cluster number N, where in the FAT(s) is the
entry for that cluster number? The only FAT type for which
this is complex is FAT12. For FAT16 and FAT32, the
computation is simple:

If(BPB_FATSz16 != 0)
     FATSz = BPB_FATSz16;
 Else
    FATSz = BPB_FATSz32;

If(FATType == FAT16)
    FATOffset = N * 2;
Else if (FATType == FAT32)
    FATOffset = N * 4;

ThisFATSecNum = BPB_ResvdSecCnt + (FATOffset /
BPB_BytsPerSec);
ThisFATEntOffset = REM(FATOffset / BPB_BytsPerSec);

REM(.) is the remainder operator. That means the remainder
after division of FATOffset by BPB_BytsPerSec. ThisFATSecNum
is the sector number of the FAT sector that contains the
entry for cluster N in the first FAT. If you want the sector
number in the second FAT, you add FATSz to ThisFATSecNum;
for the third FAT, you add 2*FATSz, and so on.

You now read sector number ThisFATSecNum (remember this is a
sector number relative to sector 0 of the FAT volume).
Assume this is read into an 8-bit byte array named SecBuff.
Also assume that the type WORD is a 16-bit unsigned and that
the type DWORD is a 32-bit unsigned.

If(FATType == FAT16)
    FAT16ClusEntryVal = *((WORD *)
&SecBuff[ThisFATEntOffset]);
Else
    FAT32ClusEntryVal = (*((DWORD *)
&SecBuff[ThisFATEntOffset])) & 0x0FFFFFFF;

Fetches the contents of that cluster. To set the contents of
this same cluster you do the following:

If(FATType == FAT16)
    *((WORD *) &SecBuff[ThisFATEntOffset]) =
FAT16ClusEntryVal;
Else {
     FAT32ClusEntryVal = FAT32ClusEntryVal & 0x0FFFFFFF;
    *((DWORD *) &SecBuff[ThisFATEntOffset]) =
        (*((DWORD *) &SecBuff[ThisFATEntOffset])) &
0xF0000000;
    *((DWORD *) &SecBuff[ThisFATEntOffset]) =
        (*((DWORD *) &SecBuff[ThisFATEntOffset])) |
FAT32ClusEntryVal;
}

Note how the FAT32 code above works. A FAT32 FAT entry is
actually only a 28-bit entry. The high 4 bits of a FAT32 FAT
entry are reserved. The only time that the high 4 bits of
FAT32 FAT entries should ever be changed is when the volume
is formatted, at which time the whole 32-bit FAT entry
should be zeroed, including the high 4 bits.

A bit more explanation is in order here, because this point
about FAT32 FAT entries seems to cause a great deal of
confusion. Basically 32-bit FAT entries are not really 32-
bit values; they are only 28-bit values. For example, all of
these 32-bit cluster entry values: 0x10000000, 0xF0000000,
and 0x00000000 all indicate that the cluster is FREE,
because you ignore the high 4 bits when you read the cluster
entry value. If the 32-bit free cluster value is currently
0x30000000 and you want to mark this cluster as bad by
storing the value 0x0FFFFFF7 in it. Then the 32-bit entry
will contain the value 0x3FFFFFF7 when you are done, because
you must preserve the high 4 bits when you write in the
0x0FFFFFF7 bad cluster mark.

Take note that because the BPB_BytsPerSec value is always
divisible by 2 and 4, you never have to worry about a FAT16
or FAT32 FAT entry spanning over a sector boundary (this is
not true of FAT12).

The code for FAT12 is more complicated because there are 1.5
bytes (12-bits) per FAT entry.

    if (FATType == FAT12)
        FATOffset = N + (N / 2);
/* Multiply by 1.5 without using floating point, the divide
by 2 rounds DOWN */

    ThisFATSecNum = BPB_ResvdSecCnt + (FATOffset /
BPB_BytsPerSec);
    ThisFATEntOffset = REM(FATOffset / BPB_BytsPerSec);

We now have to check for the sector boundary case:

If(ThisFATEntOffset == (BPB_BytsPerSec - 1)) {
    /* This cluster access spans a sector boundary in the
FAT      */
    /* There are a number of strategies to handling this.
The      */
    /* easiest is to always load FAT sectors into memory
*/
    /* in pairs if the volume is FAT12 (if you want to load
*/
    /* FAT sector N, you also load FAT sector N+1
immediately      */
    /* following it in memory unless sector N is the last
FAT      */
    /* sector). It is assumed that this is the strategy used
here  */
    /* which makes this if test for a sector boundary span
*/
    /* unnecessary.
*/
}

We now access the FAT entry as a WORD just as we do for
FAT16, but if the cluster number is EVEN, we only want the
low 12-bits of the 16-bits we fetch; and if the cluster
number is ODD, we only want the high 12-bits of the 16-bits
we fetch.

 FAT12ClusEntryVal = *((WORD *) &SecBuff[ThisFATEntOffset]);
 If(N & 0x0001)
     FAT12ClusEntryVal = FAT12ClusEntryVal >> 4;  /* Cluster
number is ODD */
 Else
     FAT12ClusEntryVal = FAT12ClusEntryVal & 0x0FFF;   /*
Cluster number is EVEN */

Fetches the contents of that cluster. To set the contents of
this same cluster you do the following:

If(N & 0x0001) {
    FAT12ClusEntryVal = FAT12ClusEntryVal << 4;   /* Cluster
number is ODD */
    *((WORD *) &SecBuff[ThisFATEntOffset]) =
        (*((WORD *) &SecBuff[ThisFATEntOffset])) & 0x000F;
} Else {
    FAT12ClusEntryVal = FAT12ClusEntryVal & 0x0FFF;    /*
Cluster number is EVEN */
    *((WORD *) &SecBuff[ThisFATEntOffset]) =
        (*((WORD *) &SecBuff[ThisFATEntOffset])) & 0xF000;
}
*((WORD *) &SecBuff[ThisFATEntOffset]) =
    (*((WORD *) &SecBuff[ThisFATEntOffset])) |
FAT12ClusEntryVal;

NOTE: It is assumed that the >> operator shifts a bit value
of 0 into the high 4 bits and that the << operator shifts a
bit value of 0 into the low 4 bits.

The way the data of a file is associated with the file is as
follows. In the directory entry, the cluster number of the
first cluster of the file is recorded. The first cluster
(extent) of the file is the data associated with this first
cluster number, and the location of that data on the volume
is computed from the cluster number as described earlier
(computation of FirstSectorofCluster).

Note that a zero-length file-a file that has no data
allocated to it-has a first cluster number of 0 placed in
its directory entry. This cluster location in the FAT (see
earlier computation of ThisFATSecNum and ThisFATEntOffset)
contains either an EOC mark (End Of Clusterchain) or the
cluster number of the next cluster of the file. The EOC
value is FAT type dependant (assume FATContent is the
contents of the cluster entry in the FAT being checked to
see whether it is an EOC mark):

IsEOF = FALSE;
If(FATType == FAT12) {
    If(FATContent >= 0x0FF8)
        IsEOF = TRUE;
} else if(FATType == FAT16) {
    If(FATContent >= 0xFFF8)
        IsEOF = TRUE;
} else if (FATType == FAT32) {
    If(FATContent >= 0x0FFFFFF8)
        IsEOF = TRUE;
}

Note that the cluster number whose cluster entry in the FAT
contains the EOC mark is allocated to the file and is also
the last cluster allocated to the file. Microsoft operating
system FAT drivers use the EOC value 0x0FFF for FAT12,
0xFFFF for FAT16, and 0x0FFFFFFF for FAT32 when they set the
contents of a cluster to the EOC mark. There are various
disk utilities for Microsoft operating systems that use a
different value, however.

There is also a special "BAD CLUSTER" mark. Any cluster that
contains the "BAD CLUSTER" value in its FAT entry is a
cluster that should not be placed on the free list because
it is prone to disk errors. The "BAD CLUSTER" value is
0x0FF7 for FAT12, 0xFFF7 for FAT16, and 0x0FFFFFF7 for
FAT32. The other relevant note here is that these bad
clusters are also lost clusters-clusters that appear to be
allocated because they contain a non-zero value but which
are not part of any files allocation chain. Disk repair
utilities must recognize lost clusters that contain this
special value as bad clusters and not change the content of
the cluster entry.

NOTE: It is not possible for the bad cluster mark to be an
allocatable cluster number on FAT12 and FAT16 volumes, but
it is feasible for 0x0FFFFFF7 to be an allocatable cluster
number on FAT32 volumes. To avoid possible confusion by disk
utilities, no FAT32 volume should ever be configured such
that 0x0FFFFFF7 is an allocatable cluster number.

The list of free clusters in the FAT is nothing more than
the list of all clusters that contain the value 0 in their
FAT cluster entry. Note that this value must be fetched as
described earlier as for any other FAT entry that is not
free. This list of free clusters is not stored anywhere on
the volume; it must be computed when the volume is mounted
by scanning the FAT for entries that contain the value 0. On
FAT32 volumes, the BPB_FSInfo sector may contain a valid
count of free clusters on the volume. See the documentation
of the FAT32 FSInfo sector.

What are the two reserved clusters at the start of the FAT
for? The first reserved cluster, FAT[0], contains the
BPB_Media byte value in its low 8 bits, and all other bits
are set to 1. For example, if the BPB_Media value is 0xF8,
for FAT12 FAT[0] = 0x0FF8, for FAT16 FAT[0] = 0xFFF8, and
for FAT32 FAT[0] = 0x0FFFFFF8. The second reserved cluster,
FAT[1], is set by FORMAT to the EOC mark. On FAT12 volumes,
it is not used and is simply always contains an EOC mark.
For FAT16 and FAT32, the file system driver may use the high
two bits of the FAT[1] entry for dirty volume flags (all
other bits, are always left set to 1). Note that the bit
location is different for FAT16 and FAT32, because they are
the high 2 bits of the entry.

For FAT16:
    ClnShutBitMask  = 0x8000;
    HrdErrBitMask   = 0x4000;

For FAT32:
    ClnShutBitMask  = 0x08000000;
    HrdErrBitMask   = 0x04000000;

Bit ClnShutBitMask -     If bit is 1, volume is "clean".
               If bit is 0, volume is "dirty". This
               indicates that the file system driver did not
               Dismount the volume properly the last time it
               had the volume mounted. It would be a good
               idea to run a Chkdsk/Scandisk disk repair
               utility on it, because it may be damaged.
Bit HrdErrBitMask - If this bit is 1, no disk read/write
               errors were encountered.
               If this bit is 0, the file system driver
               encountered a disk I/O error on the Volume
               the last time it was mounted, which is an
               indicator that some sectors may have gone bad
               on the volume. It would be a good idea to run
               a Chkdsk/Scandisk disk repair utility that
               does surface analysis on it to look for new
               bad sectors.

Here are two more important notes about the FAT region of a
FAT volume:
  1.   The last sector of the FAT is not necessarily all part
     of the FAT. The FAT stops at the cluster number in the last
     FAT sector that corresponds to the entry for cluster number
     CountofClusters + 1 (see the CountofClusters computation
     earlier), and this entry is not necessarily at the end of
     the last FAT sector. FAT code should not make any
     assumptions about what the contents of the last FAT sector
     are after the CountofClusters + 1 entry. FAT format code
     should zero the bytes after this entry though.
  2.   The BPB_FATSz16 (BPB_FATSz32 for FAT32 volumes) value
     may be bigger than it needs to be. In other words, there may
     be totally unused FAT sectors at the end of each FAT in the
     FAT region of the volume. For this reason, the last sector
     of the FAT is always computed using the CountofClusters + 1
     value, never from the BPB_FATSz16/32 value. FAT code should
     not make any assumptions about what the contents of these
     "extra" FAT sectors are. FAT format code should zero the
     contents of these extra FAT sectors though.

FAT Volume Initialization
At this point, the careful reader should have one very
interesting question. Given that the FAT type (FAT12, FAT16,
or FAT32) is dependant on the number of clusters-and that
the sectors available in the data area of a FAT volume is
dependant on the size of the FAT-when handed an unformatted
volume that does not yet have a BPB, how do you determine
all this and compute the proper values to put in
BPB_SecPerClus and either BPB_FATSz16 or BPB_FATSz32? The
way Microsoft operating systems do this is with a fixed
value, several tables, and a clever piece of arithmetic.

Microsoft operating systems only do FAT12 on floppy disks.
Because there is a limited number of floppy formats that all
have a fixed size, this is done with a simple table:

 "If it is a floppy of this type, then the BPB looks like
this."

There is no dynamic computation for FAT12. For the FAT12
formats, all the computation for BPB_SecPerClus and
BPB_FATSz16 was worked out by hand on a piece of paper and
recorded in the table (being careful of course that the
resultant cluster count was always less than 4085). If your
media is larger than 4 MB, do not bother with FAT12. Use
smaller BPB_SecPerClus values so that the volume will be
FAT16.

The rest of this section is totally specific to drives that
have 512 bytes per sector. You cannot use these tables, or
the clever arithmetic, with drives that have a different
sector size. The "fixed value" is simply a volume size that
is the "FAT16 to FAT32 cutover value". Any volume size
smaller than this is FAT16 and any volume of this size or
larger is FAT32. For Windows, this value is 512 MB. Any FAT
volume smaller than 512 MB is FAT16, and any FAT volume of
512 MB or larger is FAT32.

Please don't draw an incorrect conclusion here.

There are many FAT16 volumes out there that are larger than
512 MB. There are various ways to force the format to be
FAT16 rather than the default of FAT32, and there is a great
deal of code that implements different limits. All we are
talking about here is the default cutover value for MS-DOS
and Windows on volumes that have not yet been formatted.
There are two tables-one is for FAT16 and the other is for
FAT32. An entry in these tables is selected based on the
size of the volume in 512 byte sectors (the value that will
go in BPB_TotSec16 or BPB_TotSec32), and the value that this
table sets is the BPB_SecPerClus value.

So given a disk size and a FAT type of FAT16 or FAT32, we
now have a BPB_SecPerClus value. The only thing we have left
is do is to compute how many sectors the FAT takes up so
that we can set BPB_FATSz16 or BPB_FATSz32. Note that at
this point we assume that BPB_RootEntCnt, BPB_RsvdSecCnt,
and BPB_NumFATs are appropriately set. We also assume that
DskSize is the size of the volume that we are either going
to put in BPB_TotSec32 or BPB_TotSec16.

RootDirSectors = ((BPB_RootEntCnt * 32) + (BPB_BytsPerSec -
1)) / BPB_BytsPerSec;
TmpVal1 = DskSize - (BPB_ResvdSecCnt + RootDirSectors);
TmpVal2 = (256 * BPB_SecPerClus) + BPB_NumFATs;
If(FATType == FAT32)
    TmpVal2 = TmpVal2 / 2;
FATSz = (TMPVal1 + (TmpVal2 - 1)) / TmpVal2;
If(FATType == FAT32) {
    BPB_FATSz16 = 0;
    BPB_FATSz32 = FATSz;
} else {
    BPB_FATSz16 = LOWORD(FATSz);
    /* there is no BPB_FATSz32 in a FAT16 BPB */
}

Do not spend too much time trying to figure out why this
math works. The basis for the computation is complicated;
the important point is that this is how Microsoft operating
systems do it, and it works. Note, however, that this math
does not work perfectly. It will occasionally set a FATSz
that is up to 2 sectors too large for FAT16, and
occasionally up to 8 sectors too large for FAT32. It will
never compute a FATSz value that is too small, however.
Because it is OK to have a FATSz that is too large, at the
expense of wasting a few sectors, the fact that this
computation is surprisingly simple more than makes up for it
being off in a safe way in some cases.

FAT32 FSInfo Sector Structure and Backup Boot Sector
On a FAT32 volume, the FAT can be a large data structure,
unlike on FAT16 where it is limited to a maximum of 128K
worth of sectors and FAT12 where it is limited to a maximum
of 6K worth of sectors. For this reason, a provision is made
to store the "last known" free cluster count on the FAT32
volume so that it does not have to be computed as soon as an
API call is made to ask how much free space there is on the
volume (like at the end of a directory listing). The FSInfo
sector number is the value in the BPB_FSInfo field; for
Microsoft operating systems it is always set to 1. Here is
the structure of the FSInfo sector:

FAT32 FSInfo Sector Structure and Backup Boot Sector
Name       Offs  Size  Description
           et    (byt
           (byt  es)
           e)
FSI_LeadSi 0     4     Value 0x41615252. This lead
g                      signature is used to validate that
                       this is in fact an FSInfo sector.
FSI_Reserv 4     480   This field is currently reserved
ed1                    for future expansion. FAT32 format
                       code should always initialize all
                       bytes of this field to 0. Bytes in
                       this field must currently never be
                       used.
FSI_StrucS 484   4     Value 0x61417272. Another
ig                     signature that is more localized
                       in the sector to the location of
                       the fields that are used.
FSI_Free_C 488   4     Contains the last known free
ount                   cluster count on the volume. If
                       the value is 0xFFFFFFFF, then the
                       free count is unknown and must be
                       computed. Any other value can be
                       used, but is not necessarily
                       correct. It should be range
                       checked at least to make sure it
                       is <= volume cluster count.
FSI_Nxt_Fr 492   4     This is a hint for the FAT driver.
ee                     It indicates the cluster number at
                       which the driver should start
                       looking for free clusters. Because
                       a FAT32 FAT is large, it can be
                       rather time consuming if there are
                       a lot of allocated clusters at the
                       start of the FAT and the driver
                       starts looking for a free cluster
                       starting at cluster 2. Typically
                       this value is set to the last
                       cluster number that the driver
                       allocated. If the value is
                       0xFFFFFFFF, then there is no hint
                       and the driver should start
                       looking at cluster 2. Any other
                       value can be used, but should be
                       checked first to make sure it is a
                       valid cluster number for the
                       volume.
FSI_Reserv 496   12    This field is currently reserved
ed2                    for future expansion. FAT32 format
                       code should always initialize all
                       bytes of this field to 0. Bytes in
                       this field must currently never be
                       used.
FSI_TrailS 508   4     Value 0xAA550000. This trail
ig                     signature is used to validate that
                       this is in fact an FSInfo sector.
                       Note that the high 2 bytes of this
                       value-which go into the bytes at
                       offsets 510 and 511-match the
                       signature bytes used at the same
                       offsets in sector 0.

Another feature on FAT32 volumes that is not present on
FAT16/FAT12 is the BPB_BkBootSec field. FAT16/FAT12 volumes
can be totally lost if the contents of sector 0 of the
volume are overwritten or sector 0 goes bad and cannot be
read. This is a "single point of failure" for FAT16 and
FAT12 volumes. The BPB_BkBootSec field reduces the severity
of this problem for FAT32 volumes, because starting at that
sector number on the volume-6-there is a backup copy of the
boot sector information including the volume's BPB.

In the case where the sector 0 information has been
accidentally overwritten, all a disk repair utility has to
do is restore the boot sector(s) from the backup copy. In
the case where sector 0 goes bad, this allows the volume to
be mounted so that the user can access data before replacing
the disk.

This second case-sector 0 goes bad-is the reason why no
value other than 6 should ever be placed in the
BPB_BkBootSec field. If sector 0 is unreadable, various
operating systems are "hard wired" to check for backup boot
sector(s) starting at sector 6 of the FAT32 volume. Note
that starting at the BPB_BkBootSec sector is a complete boot
record. The Microsoft FAT32 "boot sector" is actually three
512-byte sectors long. There is a copy of all three of these
sectors starting at the BPB_BkBootSec sector. A copy of the
FSInfo sector is also there, even though the BPB_FSInfo
field in this backup boot sector is set to the same value as
is stored in the sector 0 BPB.

NOTE: All 3 of these sectors have the 0xAA55 signature in
sector offsets 510 and 511, just like the first boot sector
does (see the earlier discussion at the end of the BPB
structure description).

FAT Directory Structure
This is the most simple explanation of FAT directory
entries. This document totally ignores the Long File Name
architecture and only talks about short directory entries.
For a more complete description of FAT directory structure,
see the document "FAT: Long Name On-Media Format
Specification".

A FAT directory is nothing but a "file" composed of a linear
list of 32-byte structures. The only special directory,
which must always be present, is the root directory. For
FAT12 and FAT16 media, the root directory is located in a
fixed location on the disk immediately following the last
FAT and is of a fixed size in sectors computed from the
BPB_RootEntCnt value (see computations for RootDirSectors
earlier in this document). For FAT12 and FAT16 media, the
first sector of the root directory is sector number relative
to the first sector of the FAT volume:

FirstRootDirSecNum = BPB_ResvdSecCnt + (BPB_NumFATs *
BPB_FATSz16);

For FAT32, the root directory can be of variable size and is
a cluster chain, just like any other directory is. The first
cluster of the root directory on a FAT32 volume is stored in
BPB_RootClus. Unlike other directories, the root directory
itself on any FAT type does not have any date or time
stamps, does not have a file name (other than the implied
file name "\"), and does not contain "." and ".." files as
the first two directory entries in the directory. The only
other special aspect of the root directory is that it is the
only directory on the FAT volume for which it is valid to
have a file that has only the ATTR_VOLUME_ID attribute bit
set (see below).

DIR_WrtTime  22     2    Time of last write. Note that

DIR_Name[0]
Special notes about the first byte (DIR_Name[0]) of a FAT
directory entry:

˙    If DIR_Name[0] == 0xE5, then the directory entry is
 free (there is no file or directory name in this entry).

˙    If DIR_Name[0] == 0x00, then the directory entry is
 free (same as for 0xE5), and there are no allocated
 directory entries after this one (all of the DIR_Name[0]
 bytes in all of the entries after this one are also set to
 0).

 The special 0 value, rather than the 0xE5 value, indicates
 to FAT file system driver code that the rest of the
 entries in this directory do not need to be examined
 because they are all free.

˙    If DIR_Name[0] == 0x05, then the actual file name
 character for this byte is 0xE5. 0xE5 is actually a valid
 KANJI lead byte value for the character set used in Japan.
 The special 0x05 value is used so that this special file
 name case for Japan can be handled properly and not cause
 FAT file system code to think that the entry is free.

The DIR_Name field is actually broken into two parts+ the 8-
character main part of the name, and the 3-character
extension. These two parts are "trailing space padded" with
bytes of 0x20.

DIR_Name[0] may not equal 0x20. There is an implied '.'
character between the main part of the name and the
extension part of the name that is not present in DIR_Name.
Lower case characters are not allowed in DIR_Name (what
these characters are is country specific).

The following characters are not legal in any bytes of
DIR_Name:
˙    Values less than 0x20 except for the special case of
 0x05 in DIR_Name[0] described above.
˙    0x22, 0x2A, 0x2B, 0x2C, 0x2E, 0x2F, 0x3A, 0x3B, 0x3C,
0x3D, 0x3E, 0x3F, 0x5B, 0x5C, 0x5D, and 0x7C.

Here are some examples of how a user-entered name maps into
DIR_Name:

"foo.bar"            -> "FOO     BAR"
"FOO.BAR"            -> "FOO     BAR"
"Foo.Bar"            -> "FOO     BAR"
"foo"                -> "FOO        "
"foo."               -> "FOO        "
"PICKLE.A"           -> "PICKLE  A  "
"prettybg.big"       -> "PRETTYBGBIG"
".big"               -> illegal, DIR_Name[0] cannot be 0x20

In FAT directories all names are unique. Look at the first
three examples earlier. Those different names all refer to
the same file, and there can only be one file with DIR_Name
set to "FOO     BAR" in any directory.

DIR_Attr specifies attributes of the file:

  ATTR_READ_ONLY  Indicates that writes to the file should
                   fail.
  ATTR_HIDDEN     Indicates that normal directory listings
                   should not show this file.
  ATTR_SYSTEM     Indicates that this is an operating
                   system file.
  ATTR_VOLUME_ID  There should only be one "file" on the
                   volume that has this attribute set, and
                   that file must be in the root directory.
                   This name of this file is actually the
                   label for the volume. DIR_FstClusHI and
                   DIR_FstClusLO must always be 0 for the
                   volume label (no data clusters are
                   allocated to the volume label file).
  ATTR_DIRECTORY  Indicates that this file is actually a
                   container for other files.
  ATTR_ARCHIVE    This attribute supports backup
                   utilities. This bit is set by the FAT
                   file system driver when a file is
                   created, renamed, or written to. Backup
                   utilities may use this attribute to
                   indicate which files on the volume have
                   been modified since the last time that a
                   backup was performed.

Note that the ATTR_LONG_NAME attribute bit combination
indicates that the "file" is actually part of the long name
entry for some other file. See the FAT Long Filename
specification for more information on this attribute
combination.

When a directory is created, a file with the ATTR_DIRECTORY
bit set in its DIR_Attr field, you set its DIR_FileSize to
0. DIR_FileSize is not used and is always 0 on a file with
the ATTR_DIRECTORY attribute (directories are sized by
simply following their cluster chains to the EOC mark). One
cluster is allocated to the directory (unless it is the root
directory on a FAT16/FAT12 volume), and you set
DIR_FstClusLO and DIR_FstClusHI to that cluster number and
place an EOC mark in that clusters entry in the FAT. Next,
you initialize all bytes of that cluster to 0. If the
directory is the root directory, you are done (there are no
dot or dotdot entries in the root directory). If the
directory is not the root directory, you need to create two
special entries in the first two 32-byte directory entries
of the directory (the first two 32 byte entries in the data
region of the cluster you just allocated).

The first directory entry has DIR_Name set to:
".          "

The second has DIR_Name set to:
"..         "

These are called the dot and dotdot entries. The
DIR_FileSize field on both entries is set to 0, and all of
the date and time fields in both of these entries are set to
the same values as they were in the directory entry for the
directory that you just created. You now set DIR_FstClusLO
and DIR_FstClusHI for the dot entry (the first entry) to the
same values you put in those fields for the directories
directory entry (the cluster number of the cluster that
contains the dot and dotdot entries).

Finally, you set DIR_FstClusLO and DIR_FstClusHI for the
dotdot entry (the second entry) to the first cluster number
of the directory in which you just created the directory
(value is 0 if this directory is the root directory even for
FAT32 volumes).

Here is the summary for the dot and dotdot entries:
˙    The dot entry is a directory that points to itself.
˙    The dotdot entry points to the starting cluster of the
 parent of this directory (which is 0 if this directories
 parent is the root directory).

Date and Time Formats
Many FAT file systems do not support Date/Time other than
DIR_WrtTime and DIR_WrtDate. For this reason,
DIR_CrtTimeMil, DIR_CrtTime, DIR_CrtDate, and DIR_LstAccDate
are actually optional fields. DIR_WrtTime and DIR_WrtDate
must be supported, however. If the other date and time
fields are not supported, they should be set to 0 on file
create and ignored on other file operations.

Date Format. A FAT directory entry date stamp is a 16-bit
field that is basically a date relative to the MS-DOS epoch
of 01/01/1980. Here is the format (bit 0 is the LSB of the
16-bit word, bit 15 is the MSB of the 16-bit word):

     Bits 0-4: Day of month, valid value range 1-31
     inclusive.
     Bits 5-8: Month of year, 1 = January, valid value range
     1-12 inclusive.
     Bits 9-15: Count of years from 1980, valid value range
     0-127 inclusive (1980-2107).

Time Format. A FAT directory entry time stamp is a 16-bit
field that has a granularity of 2 seconds. Here is the
format (bit 0 is the LSB of the 16-bit word, bit 15 is the
MSB of the 16-bit word).

     Bits 0-4: 2-second count, valid value range 0-29
     inclusive (0 - 58 seconds).
     Bits 5-10: Minutes, valid value range 0-59 inclusive.
     Bits 11-15: Hours, valid value range 0-23 inclusive.

The valid time range is from Midnight 00:00:00 to 23:59:58.

Other Notes Relating to FAT Directories
˙    Long File Name directory entries are identical on all
 FAT types. See the FAT Long File Name Specification for
 details.

˙    DIR_FileSize is a 32-bit field. For FAT32 volumes, your
 FAT file system driver must not allow a cluster chain to be
 created that is longer than 0x100000000 bytes, and the last
 byte of the last cluster in a chain that long cannot be
 allocated to the file. This must be done so that no file has
 a file size > 0xFFFFFFFF bytes. This is a fundamental limit
 of all FAT file systems. The maximum allowed file size on a
 FAT volume is 0xFFFFFFFF (4,294,967,295) bytes.

˙    Similarly, a FAT file system driver must not allow a
 directory (a file that is actually a container for other
 files) to be larger than 65,536 * 32 (2,097,152) bytes.
 
 NOTE: This limit does not apply to the number of files in
 the directory. This limit is on the size of the directory
 itself and has nothing to do with the content of the
 directory. There are two reasons for this limit:

 1.   Because FAT directories are not sorted or indexed, it
    is a bad idea to create huge directories; otherwise,
    operations like creating a new entry (which requires every
    allocated directory entry to be checked to verify that the
    name doesn't already exist in the directory) become very
    slow.
 2.   There are many FAT file system drivers and disk
    utilities, including Microsoft's, that expect to be able to
    count the entries in a directory using a 16-bit WORD
    variable. For this reason, directories cannot have more than
    16-bits worth of entries.

Specification Compliance
Compliance with this specification is defined by testing on
the FAT reference operating system(s). The reference
operating systems for FAT are Microsoft Windows 98 and
Microsoft Windows 2000 (based on NT Technology).

Your FAT volume is in compliance with this specification if
and only if both of the reference operating systems will
mount the volume, check it for errors using the operating
system supplied disk tools (Chkdsk.exe for Windows 2000 and
Scandisk.exe for Windows 98) and fail to find any errors.
The basic procedure is to manufacture a FAT volume using
your system and tools and then move the disk, or disk media
for a removable drive, to a computer running the reference
operating systems and test it.
