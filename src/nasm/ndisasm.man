DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       The nnddiissaassmm command generates a disassembly listing of the
       binary file _i_n_f_i_l_e and directs it to stdout.

   OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       --hh     Causes  nnddiissaassmm to exit immediately, after giving a
              summary of its invocation options.

       --rr     Causes nnddiissaassmm to exit immediately, after  display­
              ing its version number.

       --oo _o_r_i_g_i_n
              Specifies  the  notional load address for the file.
              This option causes nnddiissaassmm to get the addresses  it
              lists  down  the  left  hand margin, and the target
              addresses of PC-relative jumps and calls, right.

       --ss _s_y_n_c_-_p_o_i_n_t
              Manually specifies a synchronisation address,  such
              that  nnddiissaassmm  will not output any machine instruc­
              tion which encompasses bytes on both sides  of  the
              address. Hence the instruction which _s_t_a_r_t_s at that
              address will be correctly disassembled.

       --ee _h_d_r_l_e_n
              Specifies a number of bytes  to  discard  from  the
              beginning  of the file before starting disassembly.
              This does not count towards the calculation of  the
              disassembly offset: the first _d_i_s_a_s_s_e_m_b_l_e_d instruc­
              tion will be  shown  starting  at  the  given  load
              address.

       --kk _o_f_f_s_e_t_,_l_e_n_g_t_h
              Specifies  that  _l_e_n_g_t_h bytes, starting from disas­
              sembly offset _o_f_f_s_e_t, should be skipped over  with­
              out  generating any output. The skipped bytes still
              count towards the calculation  of  the  disassembly
              offset.

       --aa or --ii
              Enables  automatic  (or  intelligent) sync mode, in
              which nnddiissaassmm will attempt to guess where  synchro­
              nisation should be performed, by means of examining

              the target addresses  of  the  relative  jumps  and
              calls it disassembles.

       --bb _b_i_t_s
              Specifies either 16-bit or 32-bit mode. The default
              is 16-bit mode.

       --uu     Specifies 32-bit mode, more  compactly  than  using
              `-b 32'.

       --pp _v_e_n_d_o_r
              Prefers  instructions  as defined by _v_e_n_d_o_r in case
              of a conflict.  Known _v_e_n_d_o_r names  include  iinntteell,
              aammdd, ccyyrriixx, and iiddtt.  The default is iinntteell.

       nnddiissaassmm  only  disassembles binary files: it has no under­
       standing of the header information present  in  object  or
       executable  files.  If  you  want to disassemble an object
       file, you should probably be using oobbjjdduummpp(11).

       Auto-sync mode won't necessarily cure all your  synchroni­
       sation problems: a sync marker can only be placed automat­
       ically if a jump or call instruction is found to refer  to
       it  _b_e_f_o_r_e  nnddiissaassmm actually disassembles that part of the
       code. Also, if spurious jumps or calls result from  disas­
       sembling  non-machine-code  data,  sync  markers  may  get
       placed in strange places. Feel free to turn auto-sync  off
       and go back to doing it manually if necessary.

       nnddiissaassmm  can  only  keep track of 8192 sync markers inter­
       nally at once: this is to do with portability,  since  DOS
       machines  don't  take  kindly to more than 64K being allo­
       cated at a time.
