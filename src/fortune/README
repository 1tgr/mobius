GNU fortune 1.0.0

From an idea in BSD fortune.c - I think that this file has been
redesigned sufficiently including major flow control modifications and a
brand new memory model. I have tried to maintain the BSD style of the
code. However it has been ENTIRELY rewritten and typed from scratch and
is NOT a modified copy of fortune.c.

Also included with this file is the original Notes file from the Berkeley
fortune. If you want to create your own fortune files, you will have to get
the Berkeley strfile, I am not including it with this distribution as it is
of no interest to me as a coder. I am only interested in 'large' data sets,
optimisation and other things like that. I don't care how long strfile
takes. However, the lack of recursiveness and the bad memory model in
fortune.c needed IMHO a revamp. This is it.

Soon I hope to release a datafile set to go with the program, and hopefully
a shell script to set them all up. However, I am currently sitting on a
database of some 40,000 quotes from various sources and am looking at the
mammoth task of attributing them all, sorting them out by author and
subject, offensiveness and otherwise, and categorising them sensibly. A
recursive fortune using the new regular expression engine is the first step
on the way to doing this.

Please send me fortune files. NOT THE STANDARD FORTUNE FILES.  But if
you do have quotes, please send them to me, I would like to add them to
the archive. I currently have about 40,000 quotes. Please attribute the
quotes you send.

Many thanks to the people who sent me dungeon.f, I now have the complete
source code and have written a MUD of my own.
