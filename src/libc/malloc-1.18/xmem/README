xmem takes the trace output of my malloc with mal_trace(1) and plots
a dynamic picture of the heap.

black (foreground) represents allocated space, white (foreground)
represents free space, gray is outside our heap.

Uses the X Toolkit which makes it easy to expand and change.
Accepts standard Xt options.

This was a quick & dirty hack.  Needs cleanup.
